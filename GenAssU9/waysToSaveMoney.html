			<h3>Get Cooking!</h3>
			<p>This one is obvious. You can save a ton of money by cooking your meals at home rather than going out. And, unlike the couple in the photo, you don't need a dazzling white smile to do it.</p>
			<p>Obviously there's a wide range of restaurants, and you're going to save a lot more by cutting out michelin-starred dining experiences as opposed to your burrito shacks, but it all adds up. Similarly there's a range of groceries you can purchase, from budget ramen to truffles. But overall, if you plan your meals in advance to minimize wastage, you should be able to save a pretty penny by eating at home. On top of all that, you can avoid liquor surcharges, tax, tips by cooking for yourself.</p>
			<p>And with the internet it's never been easier to find recipes for whatever level of domestic god(dess) you are! Sites like <a href="www.supercook.com">Supercook</a> and <a href="www.myfridgefood.com">My Fridge Food</a> let you filter recipes based on what you already have in your fridge or pantry. Supermarket chains will also often highlight recipes using ingredients that they currently have on special or are in season.</p>
			<p>Cooking for yourself allows you to be a bit healthier, as you know exactly what you're putting in your food. It also gives you a chance to experiment with new foods and cuisines, and develop a life-long skill.</p>

			<h3>Go to early movies at AMC</h3>
			<p>AMC movie theatres offer discounted tickets if you see a movie before noon. While it may be hard to drag yourself out of bed so early, hopefully saving around $6 per adult ticket is enough motivation.</p>
