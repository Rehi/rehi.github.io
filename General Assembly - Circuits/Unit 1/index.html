	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I'm an Adventure Seeker, living in Manhattan. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because it'll help me develop my business ideas.</p>

	<h2>My Mission</h2>
	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as an entrepreneur because I love working in dynamic environments where I can make a real impact.</p>

	<h2>My Experience</h2>
	<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Vice President,</strong> Macquarie Bank <br> 
			<em>Manhattan</em>, 2013 - 2014</li>
		<li><strong>Manager,</strong> Challenger Financial Services <br> 
			<em>London</em>, 2006 - 2011</li>
		<li><strong>Analyst,</strong> Westpac Institutional Bank <br> 
			<em>Sydney</em>, 2006 - 2007</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Education</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Masters of Business Administration,</strong> University of Pennsylvania <br> 
			<em>2013</em></li>
		<li><strong>Bachelor of Commerce,</strong> University of New South Wales <br>
			<em>2004</em></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Other</h2>
	<p>I love to travel, having lived in 3 different continents and visited 6 (Antarctica is the only one left!). I'm a bookworm who enjoys historical fiction, business books and trashy vampire novels equally. I love thinking about why people behave the way they do, and how small, simple innovations can dramatically change people's lives. </p>
